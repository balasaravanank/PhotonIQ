SOLAR POWER OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM
Project Documentation
Hackathon 2026 | Team Submission

1. Project Overview
Solar energy is one of the most abundant renewable sources, yet most solar installations lose 25-40% efficiency due to poor panel orientation, lack of real-time monitoring, and dirty panel surfaces. Our Solar Power Optimization System addresses these critical gaps by combining IoT hardware with intelligent software.

Project Title
Solar Power Optimization System
Domain
IoT + AI + Renewable Energy
Problem Category
Energy Efficiency & Sustainability
Target Users
Solar panel owners, farms, industries, institutions
Expected Efficiency Gain
30-40% increase over fixed-panel systems

2. Problem Statement
Solar panels lose efficiency due to two main issues:
Improper panel angle: Fixed panels cannot track the sun, losing 25-35% potential energy
Lack of real-time monitoring: Without live data, faults and inefficiencies go undetected
Dust accumulation: Dirty panels can lose up to 25% efficiency with no alert system
No predictive analytics: Owners cannot forecast output for energy planning

Current solutions are expensive, require expert installation, and provide no user-friendly interface for real-time control or historical analysis.
3. Proposed Solution
We propose a complete end-to-end Solar Power Optimization System consisting of:
Dual-axis solar tracking using LDR sensors and servo motors
Real-time power output monitoring using INA219 current/voltage sensors
AI-based power prediction using weather + historical data
Dust/dirt detection alert system
Live web dashboard with analytics, historical graphs, and control panel
Arduino-to-web communication via USB Serial port

7. Key Features
7.1 Dual-Axis Solar Tracking
Four LDR sensors positioned in quadrants detect the brightest light source. The Arduino calculates the difference between sensor pairs and adjusts two servo motors (horizontal and vertical axis) to point the panel toward maximum sunlight. This alone delivers 30-40% more energy compared to fixed panels.
7.2 Real-Time Power Monitoring
The INA219 sensor continuously measures voltage (V), current (mA), and calculates power (W) and energy (Wh). Data is sent via USB Serial to Node.js backend and displayed live on the dashboard with gauge charts and historical line graphs.
7.3 AI-Based Power Prediction
A Python ML model (trained on historical power output + weather data) predicts the next 1-hour and next-day solar output. This helps users plan energy consumption. The model integrates with OpenWeather API for live cloud cover and irradiance data.
7.4 Dust Detection Alert
An LDR sensor placed on the panel frame detects abnormal light reduction compared to expected irradiance levels. When the ratio drops below a threshold, the dashboard sends an alert: 'Panel may need cleaning - estimated 15% efficiency loss.'
7.5 Live Web Dashboard
A React.js web application shows: live power output gauge, panel angle display, efficiency comparison (fixed vs tracking), historical data charts, AI prediction graph, weather data widget, and dust alert notifications. All data updates in real-time via Firebase Realtime Database listener.
